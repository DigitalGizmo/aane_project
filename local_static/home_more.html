            <h1>African Americans in the Record</h1>
            <h3>Evidence from 18th Century Massachusetts</h3>
            <p>
                Eighteenth century servitude in its many forms was extremely common throughout the colonies.  While the greatest number of enslaved people lived in the south, the institution also played an integral role in New England. Enslaved African American and Indigenous people were common sights in fields, shops, and houses.  In Deerfield, Massachusetts, slavery was interwoven into the web of a closely knit community.  The Williams family alone owned at least 13, several of whom were baptized by the Reverend John Williams, who enslaved three people.

                Whether enslaved or not and regardless of the color of their skin, Deerfield men, women and children were tended by the same physicians, shopped in the same store, and worshipped at the same meetinghouse. Even non-enslavers benefitted from their labor, as Deerfield owners regularly hired them out.  The account book of Daniel Arms, Jr. documents the many occasions he hired out Titus.  Humphrey was one of many enslaved residents who were both treated by and labored for Dr. Thomas Williams, who, himself, enslaved people.  Humphrey was among approximately 18 enslaved and free African Americans who had accounts at Elijah Williams’ store in the mid-1700s. Mescheck, enslaved by Abigail and Ebenezer Hinsdale, assisted Ebenezer in the operation of trading posts in Deerfield and Hinsdale, NH.  These webs of interaction and economic relationships signify that Deerfield's free and enslaved residents crossed paths daily.

                Americans learn very little about the many significant roles played by African Americans in what is often called the birthplace of American freedom- colonial and revolutionary Massachusetts. Yet the trade in African captives undergirded New England’s maritime commercial development, and African Americans in slavery and freedom made essential contributions to New England life as artisans, laborers, poets, writers, soldiers, and ministers. Knowing this history is key to building cross-racial and cross-cultural understanding today.

                A brief note about names:  Names of enslaved people recorded in documents and other sources frequently reflected the preferences, education, and habits of their enslavers.  For example, many enslavers assigned classical names such as Titus, Caesar, Pompey, and Cato.  The repeated use of such names combined with varied spellings and the frequent lack of an accompanying surname complicates the work of identifying enslaved individuals who shared the same name while living and working in Deerfield, Massachusetts.
