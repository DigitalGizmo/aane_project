AA People
-----------

Initially, there are some people that have no aa_id -- the "note_name" field will show up in the entries table, grayed out. But eventually, the idea is that everyone will be given an id.

People who are "unknown" get an id, and the known_status of 3. 
* If it's later determined that they are one and the same with a "known" person, then that "place-holder" entry gets a 9 (descarded) and the aa_id for the relevant entries is changed to the known id.
* If the more is learned about the unknown person, then their known_status gets raised, and their aa_id stays the same in the entries.
